# Dragon Real Estate - Price Predictor

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict housing prices, leveraging a dataset that includes various socio-economic factors and property attributes. The core of this predictor is a Random Forest Regressor.

The primary objective is to build a reliable predictive model that can estimate property sale prices, which can be useful for real estate valuation, market analysis, or informing investment strategies.

---

## Features

- **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** Loads the housing dataset and performs initial data inspection (`head`, `info`, `describe`, `value_counts`).
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes scatter plots and a scatter matrix to visualize relationships and correlations between features.
- **Attribute Combination:** Explores creating new features (e.g., `TAXRM`) by combining existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
- **Train-Test Splitting:** Implements stratified shuffling to ensure the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall data distribution, particularly for skewed categorical features like `CHAS`.
- **Missing Value Imputation:** Handles missing numerical values using `SimpleImputer` with a median strategy.
- **Feature Scaling:** Applies `StandardScaler` to normalize feature scales, crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
- **Pipeline Integration:** A scikit-learn pipeline is used to streamline preprocessing steps (imputation and scaling), ensuring consistent transformations for both training and new data.
- **Random Forest Regressor:** A powerful ensemble model is chosen for its predictive capabilities in regression tasks.

---

## Model Evaluation

- Calculates Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the training data.
- Employs K-Fold Cross-Validation (10 folds) to provide a more robust and generalized estimate of the model's performance.

---

## Model Persistence

- The trained model and preprocessing pipeline are saved using `joblib` for future use without needing to retrain.

---

## Prediction Module

- Demonstrates how to load the saved model and make predictions on new, unseen data.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing tools, model selection, and pipelines.
- **Joblib:** For saving and loading Python objects (models and pipelines).

## Dataset

This project utilizes a housing price dataset (`data.csv`) placed in the project's root directory. The dataset's columns are typically those found in the Boston Housing Dataset:

| Column   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| CRIM     | Per capita crime rate by town |
| ZN       | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. |
| INDUS    | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town |
| CHAS     | Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise) |
| NOX      | Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million) |
| RM       | Average number of rooms per dwelling |
| AGE      | Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940 |
| DIS      | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers |
| RAD      | Index of accessibility to radial highways |
| TAX      | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000 |
| PTRATIO  | Pupil-teacher ratio by town |
| B        | 1000(Bk−0.63)^2, where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town |
| LSTAT    | % lower status of the population |
| MEDV     | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (Target variable) |

> **Note:** Ensure your `data.csv` file matches this column structure.

## Installation and Setup

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DragonRealEstate-Price-Predictor.git
   cd DragonRealEstate-Price-Predictor
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username if cloning.

2. **Obtain `data.csv`:** Download the Boston Housing Dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) and place it directly in the `DragonRealEstate-Price-Predictor/` directory.

3. **Create `requirements.txt`:** Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root of your project with the following content:
   ```
   pandas
   numpy
   matplotlib
   scikit-learn
   joblib
   ```

4. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Install Jupyter Notebook (optional):**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## How to Run the Project

The entire project workflow is encapsulated within the `DragonRealEstate.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Your web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter interface.

2. **Open the Notebook:** Click on `DragonRealEstate.ipynb` to open it.

3. **Execute Cells:** Go through the notebook from top to bottom, executing each cell. The notebook will perform:
   - Data loading and initial exploration
   - Train-test splitting
   - Handling of missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Model training (Random Forest Regressor)
   - Model evaluation using RMSE and 10-fold cross-validation
   - Saving the trained model (`Dragon.joblib`)
   - Making predictions on a sample of the test data

Outputs, including data descriptions, correlation matrices, model scores, and final predictions, will be displayed directly within the notebook.

## Results

After running the notebook, you will see various outputs:

- **Initial Data Overview:** Details on the dataset's structure, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
- **Correlations:** Insights into how different features correlate with each other and with the target variable (`MEDV`).
- **Cross-Validation Scores:** The mean and standard deviation of the RMSE scores from the 10-fold cross-validation, providing a robust measure of model performance. In your notebook, the `rmse_scores` mean is approximately **2.91**.
- **Final Test Set RMSE:** The Root Mean Squared Error of the model on the unseen test data. In your notebook, the `final_rmse` is approximately **2.91**.

These metrics indicate how well the model predicts housing prices, with lower RMSE values signifying better accuracy.

---

## Saving and Loading the Model

- The trained `RandomForestRegressor` model is saved using joblib.
- **Saved Model File:** `Dragon.joblib`

To load and use this model in a separate Python script or another notebook, you would typically load both the `my_pipeline` (for preprocessing) and the model.

> **Important Note on Saving:**  
> Your `DragonRealEstate.ipynb` currently saves only the model (`dump(model, 'Dragon.joblib')`). For a fully deployable system, it's best practice to save the entire fitted preprocessing pipeline as well.

**To do this:**
```python
# After cell 39 (where my_pipeline is fit_transformed)
from joblib import dump
dump(my_pipeline, 'Dragon_pipeline.joblib')
dump(model, 'Dragon_model.joblib')
```

**To load for predictions:**
```python
from joblib import load
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np  # Needed for potential NaN values in new_data_example

# Load the saved pipeline and model
my_pipeline_loaded = load('Dragon_pipeline.joblib')
model_loaded = load('Dragon_model.joblib')

# Example new data (must match training data structure)
new_data_example = pd.DataFrame({
    'CRIM': [0.00632], 'ZN': [18.0], 'INDUS': [2.31], 'CHAS': [0],
    'NOX': [0.538], 'RM': [6.575], 'AGE': [65.2], 'DIS': [4.0900],
    'RAD': [1], 'TAX': [296], 'PTRATIO': [15.3], 'B': [396.90], 'LSTAT': [4.98]
})

# Transform and predict
processed_new_data = my_pipeline_loaded.transform(new_data_example)
predicted_price = model_loaded.predict(processed_new_data)
print(f"Predicted price for the new data: ${predicted_price[0]:.2f} (in $1000s)")
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimal hyperparameters.
- **More Feature Engineering:** Create additional synthetic features (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms).
- **Outlier Detection & Handling:** Analyze and remove or transform outliers.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare `RandomForestRegressor` with other models like `LinearRegression`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`, `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, etc.
- **Residual Analysis:** Plot residuals to check for model weaknesses.
- **Deployment:** Develop a simple web application (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) to host the trained model as an API.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Use Plotly or Bokeh for more interactive plots.
